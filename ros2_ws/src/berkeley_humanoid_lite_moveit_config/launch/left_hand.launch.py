"""Bring up a second DexHand as the robot's left hand.

Two nodes:

  * `dexhand_bringup`'s own `hand_driver`, in the `/left_hand` namespace and
    pointed at a second serial port. It still thinks it is a right hand.
  * `left_hand_adapter.py`, which translates `L_` names to the driver's `R_`
    names and back, and republishes the driver's joint states.

The driver publishes to an **absolute** `/joint_states`, so a namespace alone
would not separate the two hands -- the remap below is what keeps the left
driver's raw `R_` names off the global topic. Only the adapter's translated
`L_` names get there.

    ros2 launch berkeley_humanoid_lite_moveit_config left_hand.launch.py \\
        serial_port:=/dev/ttyACM1

This needs the dexhand workspace on the environment as well as this one:

    source ~/Desktop/dexhand_moveit_ws/install/setup.bash

Servo output starts off, as it does for the right hand:

    ros2 service call /left_hand_adapter/enable std_srvs/srv/SetBool '{data: true}'
